## Essential Questions
- What does consent and pleasure look like in digital spaces?
- How can we learn to navigate risk and privacy while relating with each other on platforms that collect our data? 
- How can we imagine and design liberatory, playful, and pleasurable messaging platforms that we would want to use? 
- How can we use the framework of speculative design to imagine and build more loving ways of communicating?


## Introduction
Join us for a discussion and workshop about intimacy, relationship-building, and pleasure on digital platforms. We’ll build skills for navigating privacy and consent in the text messages, DMs, snaps, and images we share with each other online. Drawing on our collective experiences with intimacy on the internet, we will work together to vision and design the safe, playful, digital platforms of our dreams.


### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment
Ages 16-22

### Outcomes & Goals
- In this workshop we will be building skills for navigating privacy and consent in the text messages, DMs, snaps, and images we share with each other online.
- Students will walk away with more knowledge about how to navigate risk and privacy while relating with each other on digital platforms. They will also walk away with a deeper understanding of how they can use the framework of speculative design to imagine and build more loving ways of communicating.

### Pacing / Duration
- 20 min: Relationship building and intimacy online 
- 20 min: Digital security discussion and skillbuilding 
- 25 min: Breakout rooms into speculative design activity
- 25 min Shareback by group

## Materials Needed
Pen and paper, colored pencils optional

## Exercise Descriptions
* 20 min: Relationship building and intimacy online
  * What is consent IRL? What does consent look like on digital platforms? How can the people we relate to online make us feel more safe/secure/attended to on digital messaging platforms? What values, boundaries, or agreements can we articulate with the people we are relating to?
  * Pose questions to students
  * Discussion/q&a on mic or in the chat/on post it notes 
  * Takeaways and synthesis
 * 20 min: Digital security discussion and skillbuilding
   * Quick overview: How are platforms surveilling us, storing and selling our information online? What are the different factors that go into thinking about digital security?      * How do we think about the risks of relating online? 
   * Discuss: What are some things I already do to keep myself safe/manage risk online? 
   * Brainstorm: What tools/platforms/practices can help make me feel safer online? 
   * Run through examples: Turn on signal disappearing messages. Know where your apps/photos back up to. Delete! things!
 * 25 min: Speculative design activity
   * What is speculative design and how can it help us imagine the world we would want to live in?
   * Small group activity: design a messaging app or platform that you would want to use. What qualities would it have? What would it feel like, sound like, look like? Who would be safe there? What community standards or norms would you want to have there?
 * 25 min: shareback
   * Share sketches/words/shapes from the small group sessions
   * Are there any common themes among the apps and platforms that the groups designed?
   * How can we take these themes with us when thinking about how we relate and communicate with each other right now? 



## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next level and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.

* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
Option #1
  * First Steps - Think about everyday objects or experiences that you would like to redesign
  * Next Steps - Practice envisioning, sketching, or talking about ways you would redesign these objects and experiences 
  * Big Steps - Using themes from the design you envisioned, think about ways to implement changes in the ways you relate to objects and technologies around you. How can you use technology in ways that center your autonomy and privacy?
Option #2
  * First Steps - Think about one digital platform that you use regularly and brainstorm one way you could use it more safely in the future? 
  * Next Steps - Fill out these worksheets to do a full [data detox] (https://cdn.ttc.io/s/datadetoxkit.org/youth/Data-Detox-x-Youth_EN.pdf).
  * Big Steps - Discuss the worksheets with a friend. Are there practices or strategies you all can think of to communicate and relate more safely online? 

* Presentation: Students can share their work on Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr.
* Reflection: What are ways we can respect each other’s bodily autonomy and feelings when interacting with each other online? What are ways that we can advocate for and protect our privacy (and our friends’ privacy) online? How can imagination be a tool for creating the kinds of worlds we would want to live in?
