## Essential Questions
- What does consent and pleasure look like in digital spaces?
- How can we learn to navigate risk and privacy while relating with each other on platforms that collect our data? 
- How can we imagine and design liberatory, playful, and pleasurable messaging platforms that we would want to use? 
- How can we use the framework of speculative design to imagine and build more loving ways of communicating?


## Introduction
Join us for a discussion and workshop about intimacy, relationship-building, and pleasure on digital platforms. We’ll build skills for navigating privacy and consent in the text messages, DMs, snaps, and images we share with each other online. Drawing on our collective experiences with intimacy on the internet, we will work together to vision and design the safe, playful, digital platforms of our dreams.


### Target Audience / Prerequisite & Pre-Assessment

### Outcomes & Goals
This can be easily answered by completing these example sentences:

* Students will walk away with a deeper understanding of…

### Pacing / Duration
Number of total hours the unit will take in a typical workshop session(s). Please try to take into account transition time between instruction and hands on exercises if any prep is necessary.

## Materials Needed
What hardware, software, or other materials will students or teachers need for lessons.

### Exercises To Do Before Class
What materials (readings, tasks, exercises) should students complete before class to be prepared for the lesson.

### Vocabulary (example)
* Program: A procedure, or set of instructions, that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. 
* Programming Language: The human-readable commands and syntax (or grammar rules) used to write programs. 

## Exercise Descriptions
Descriptions of each exercise or phase of class. Similar to pacing but with more description of steps.

## Student Reflections, Takeaways & Next Steps
Additional materials for the students to leave with that can help them dig deeper into the subject or additional exercises and challenges to help students progress their knowledge to the next level and gain mastery of the subject through independent study.

* Multiple Project Exit Points: an idea of high-medium-low projects so students are locked into one end product.
  * First Steps - a simple exercise
  * Next Steps - medium exercise
  * Big Steps - a challenge or open ended study
* Presentation: how might students share their work? With peers, outside world? What media or platforms could/should be referenced to students to encourage sharing (Instagram, Tumblr...)? 
* Reflection: reflection questions that ask students to think about CS concepts and practices. How can students express what they’ve learned in some creative way?
